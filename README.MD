# The Maratus Apparatus

Maratus is a time-lapse camera for the Form 2 that hangs from a thread and follows the build platform. Maratus is a work in progress and is constructed from a Raspberry Pi Zero W, a wide angle Pi compatible camera, a micro-servo, a microphone, and some printed parts. It takes a picture of the build platform whenever it raise up to move the wiper arm. The raising of the platform is detected via real-time audio processing on the Raspberry Pi Zero running a python script.

## Acknowledgments

The logo I derived from editing and compositing together an image of a camera by [DG-RA on openclipart.org](https://openclipart.org/detail/275084/dslr-camera-+-lens-remix-hq) with an image of a Maratus Volans made by K.D. Schroeder (KDS4444 on wikimedia). This image is a previous version of Male_peacock_spider2.svg taken from wikimedia commons on a CC-BY-SA 3.0 license.

The code is my own work but contains elements pasted from previous codes I worked on as well as small clippings from various stack overflow threads. I would cite each of these except that there are many and virtually no code from site is in a recognizable form anywhere in my code at this point. Neverthless I do wish to recognize the helpfulness of this community and point out that this project would not be possible without them.
