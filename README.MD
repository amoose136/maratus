## The Maratus Apparatus

Maratus is a time-lapse camera for the Form 2 that hangs from a thread and follows the build platform. Maratus is a work in progress and is constructed from a Raspberry Pi Zero W, a wide angle Pi compatible camera, a micro-servo, a microphone, and some printed parts. It takes a picture of the build platform whenever it raise up to move the wiper arm. The raising of the platform is detected via real-time audio processing on the Raspberry Pi Zero running a python script.
